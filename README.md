# Pana - पाना

📜 The Book That Writes You

**Pana** is a personal voice-based journaling assistant designed to make daily reflection effortless. Instead of typing long entries or forgetting important moments, users simply record short voice clips throughout the day. At night, Pana processes all recordings and generates a clean, structured journal entry that summarizes the day’s events, thoughts, and insights.

Inspired by the Nepali word **“पाना (Pana)”**, meaning *page*, the project aims to transform raw voice notes into meaningful pages of a personal journal — automatically, privately, and intelligently.
